VIVAE

The Variably Intense Vocalizations of Affect and Emotion Corpus (VIVAE) consists of a set of human non-speech emotion vocalizations. The full set, comprising 1085 audio files, features eleven speakers expressing three positive (achievement/ triumph, sexual pleasure, and surprise) and three negative (anger, fear, physical pain) affective states, each parametrically varied from low to peak emotion intensity. The smaller core set of 480 files represents a fully crossed subsample of the full set (6 emotions x 4 intensities x 10 speakers x 2 items) selected based on judged authenticity.

File summary

The recordings are digitized at a 44.1-kHz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution.

Each of the 1085 VIVAE files has a unique filename following the file naming convention: [Speaker_Emotion_Intensity_Item-ID.wav]. The filename consists of a 4-part identifier (e.g., S04_surprise_peak_10.wav) defining the stimulus characteristics:

    Speaker (S01 to S11).
    Emotion (achievement, anger, fear, pain, pleasure, and surprise).
    Emotional intensity (low, moderate, strong, peak).
    Item-ID (unique integer identifier within speaker x emotion x intensity conditions)
